Table 33 - Disciplines
Definition
Disciplines are the practice areas and specialties of the actors (participants) that carry out the processes and procedures that occur during the life cycle of a construction entity.
Discussion
"Disciplines are the practice areas and specialties of the participants who are performing services during the life cycle of a construction entity, considered in light of education and training required to perform in those disciplines.  Disciplines are presented without regard to the job functions that may be performed by individuals or teams, which are classified by Table 34 – Organizational Roles.  Disciplines from Table 33 can be combined with entries from Table 34 - Organizational Roles to provide a more complete classification of a construction participant's role, such as an Electrical Contracting (discipline) Supervisor (organizational role)."
Examples
"Architecture, Interior Design, Mechanical Engineering, General Contracting, Legal Services, Finance, Real Estate Sales"
Table Uses
"Specifying and estimating construction and maintenance costs for building elements, identifying workers and estimating associated labor costs needed in the performance of specified procedures, project management and planning."
